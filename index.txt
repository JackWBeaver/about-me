Hey everybody, my names is Jack Beaver, but you all can call me Jack. My instructor for this course is Dr. Case and I am in Section 02.

I am a senior currently in my last semester here at Northwest. In December I will graduate with a BS in Data Science: Computer Science.

I am from a town not too far from Maryville called St Joseph, MO. Some of my favorite hobbies are golfing, hanging out with friends, going to the lake, and playing video games. 

My plans after I graduate are still up in the air as of right now. I have been offered a job with the company that I have worked for the past two years, but not sure yet as to if I will take it. I would like a job more in the Data Analytics field, so I am still looking and keeping my options open. If any of you know of anything or any opening feel free to share!

If any of you would like to get to know me any better, see my resume, past job experiences, or would like to connect, please add me on LinkedIn!
